# Dynamic Reviewer
*powered by _[Arachni Web UI](https://github.com/Arachni/arachni-ui-web)_*

Dynamic Reviewer is a high-performance, modular, web application security scanning framework written in Ruby and .NET Core. It is based on an open source pentest tool, named Arachni Web UI, written by Tasos “Zapotek” Laskos. 

Security Reviewer has been maintaining this tool since it was discontinued on January 18th 2020, adding its own core engine and some other enhanced features, like Enterprise-level reporting. With Arachni we share also the Dispatcher Infrastructure via Arachni-rpc protocol, and the results in AFR format. 

With Dynamic Reviewer Light-PenTest module, you can inspect your web application during running, directly from your Desktop, or using a Browser. No need to backup your data before scanning. Dynamic Reviewer will discover web site’s vulnerabilities, suggesting the exploits, without compromising its contents.If Team Reviewer has been purchased, you can import Dynamic Reviewer finding and manage them.
